# Job-Portal
Nowadays, we know that searching for jobs is so difficult in various areas like engineering, content writing, etc. To overcome this situation a job portal can be developed for providing a simple and efficient job-searching experience. 

The job portal is a MERN stack application dedicated to online information about recruiting companies as well as job seekers.

## Task to be accomplished
1. Recruiters will be able to post job descriptions on the portal and find a suitable candidate from the list.
2. Job seekers will be able to apply for the jobs posted by the recruiters.
3. An ATS(applicant tracking system) compatible resume will be provided to the job seekers in various templates.
4. A referral page will be created so that the current employees of the company can post their willingness to give referrals and job seekers can approach them for the same.
5. An anonymous company review page will be present so that job seekers can make wise decisions before joining the company.
